Basic Programs](https://github.com/Kerston2104/python-program-2nd/tree/main/1.%20Basic%20Programs): This directory contains basic Python programs that cover fundamental concepts such as variables, data types, conditionals, loops, and functions. These programs serve as a starting point for beginners to learn and practice Python programming.

- [2. Data Structures](https://github.com/Kerston2104/python-program-2nd/tree/main/2.%20Data%20Structures): This directory includes programs that demonstrate the implementation and usage of various data structures in Python, such as lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets, and arrays. The programs showcase common operations and algorithms related to these data structures.

- [3. Algorithms](https://github.com/Kerston2104/python-program-2nd/tree/main/3.%20Algorithms): In this directory, you will find programs that focus on algorithmic problem-solving. These programs cover a wide range of algorithms, including searching, sorting, recursion, dynamic programming, graph algorithms, and more. Each program provides a clear explanation of the algorithm and its implementation in Python.

- [4. Object-Oriented Programming](https://github.com/Kerston2104/python-program-2nd/tree/main/4.%20Object-Oriented%20Programming): This directory contains programs that illustrate the concepts and principles of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python. You will find examples of creating classes, defining methods and attributes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. These programs help you understand how to design and implement OOP concepts in your Python projects.

- [5. File Handling](https://github.com/Kerston2104/python-program-2nd/tree/main/5.%20File%20Handling): This directory covers programs related to file handling in Python. You will learn how to read from and write to files, manipulate file contents, handle exceptions, and work with different file formats such as CSV and JSON. These programs provide practical examples of file handling tasks that you may encounter in real-world scenarios.

- [6. Advanced Topics](https://github.com/Kerston2104/python-program-2nd/tree/main/6.%20Advanced%20Topics): The advanced topics directory contains programs that explore more advanced Python concepts and techniques. It covers topics such as regular expressions, multithreading, networking, web scraping, database connectivity, and more.
